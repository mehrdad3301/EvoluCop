# Evolocop
Evolocop is an evolutionary agent that masters a simplistic helicopter game. It uses a three layers neural net, that takes current position of the helicopter and the position of obstacles as input, and decides wether to push the helicopter. The real challenge is in training the net. There are many ways to train a network that can solve this effectively. As the name suggests Evolocop uses Evolution. See section below for how it works. 


## How it works

This was part of a course on Computational Intelligence at Amirkabir university of Technology. I was only responsible for network architecture and implementation of evolutionary algorithms. Game logic and GUI were implemented [here](https://github.com/HosseinZaredar/EvolutionaryGames). There are TODOs in place for you to fill out and make your own Evolocop much like I did!
