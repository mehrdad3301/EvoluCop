# Evolocop
Evolocop is an evolutionary agent that masters a simplistic helicopter game. It uses a three layers neural net, that takes current position of the helicopter and the position of obstacles as input, and decides wether to push the helicopter. The real challenge is in training the net. There are many ways to train a network that can solve this effectively. As the name suggests Evolocop uses Evolution. See section below for how it works.
